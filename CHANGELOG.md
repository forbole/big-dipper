## v0.37.x-patch-10

### Release Date: 24 Feb 2020

* Changed the structure of `coins.js` utility and `settings.json`. Information of multiple denoms can be defined in `settings.json`. A `bondDenom` should be defined and coins information is defined in `coins` array. `powerReduction` is the `token / power` ratio which is set to be `1,000,000` by default in the `staking` module. The display value of coins should be set correctly in the `coins` array. An example is as below.

    ```json
        "bondDenom": "umuon",
        "powerReduction": 1000000,
        "coins": [
            {
                "denom": "umuon",
                "displayName": "Muon",
                "displayNamePlural": "Muons",
                "fraction": 1000000
            }
        ],
    ```

* Update Meteor to v1.9
* [#267] Fixed Fee Decimal Places
* [#263] Fixed Tx fee to be displayed in Minting or Staking Denom depending on the fee amount
* [#262] Fixed Validator Popover in Account Section
* [#260] Fixed Token unit to display the correct Denom Name/Type  
* [#227] Added additional info to be displayed for Parameter Change Proposal and Community Pool Spend Proposal
